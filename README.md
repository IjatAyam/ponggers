<h1>Ponggers</h1>

<b>Ponggers is a peer 2 peer 3D pong game developed using [PeerJS](https://github.com/peers/peerjs)</b>

This game was developed for a hackathon - I wanted to develop a multiplayer 3D pong game that uses PeerJS for P2P networking and ThreeJS for the 3D models.

You play as Maxwell the cat. Move left and right to hit the ball towards the fake Maxwell enemy to defeat them.

Maxwell the cat model is based on ["dingus the cat"](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/dingus-the-cat-2ca7f3c1957847d6a145fc35de9046b0) by [bean(alwayshasbean)](https://sketchfab.com/alwayshasbean) licensed under [CC-BY-4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)
